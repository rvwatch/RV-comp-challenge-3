Static Comp Challenge 3


This project was definitely more intense than I expected. I tried to keep things as basic as possible, but found I kept adding more and more to compensate for odd use cases. I'm not too excited about the final results as I'm certain with a bit more time I could really get this polished up. As it sits there are a few wonky interactions and movements that I'm sure will stick out like sore thumbs. It was good to go back into the CSS hell and dig my way out again.
